/// Deliberately avoids ModelState, TempData and Url: all three dereference PageContext,
/// which is null on a hand-constructed PageModel, and staying off them is what lets the
/// tests do <c>new RegisterModel(service)</c> without a host. Using a plain Error string
/// also keeps the form's wording identical to the JSON API's, since both come from

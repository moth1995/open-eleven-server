# pes2010.exe — Session Flow & Verified Command Fields (Pass 2)

Companion to [`pes2010_cmd_commands.md`](./pes2010_cmd_commands.md) (pass 1: full command inventory +
input/output direction). This rewrite replaces an earlier version of this file that leaned on mining
adjacent strings in `.rdata` — that approach produced noisy, unordered, low-confidence output with no
sense of sequence. This version is grounded in **decompiled code from the actual call sites**, and it's
organized around the question that actually matters: *if I send command X, what happens next?*

## How this was derived

The whole client funnels every network send through one wrapper, `FUN_00768e50`. It has exactly **123
distinct caller functions** across the game's code — each one is the real game/UI logic that builds one
specific command's request and (usually, right there or in a paired poll loop) reads its response. All 123
were decompiled. Per call site this gives:

- The literal **request keys** — string literals passed to the option-setters (`FUN_00768ea0` = set string
  field, `FUN_00768ee0`/`f00` = set int/enum field, `FUN_00768f60` = set list field, `FUN_00768fa0` = merge
  a pre-built sub-object).
- The literal **response keys actually read** — via `FUN_00753250` (string), `FUN_00753450` (scalar),
  `FUN_00753550` (int), and `FUN_00753950` (compare a field, almost always `"result"`, against a literal
  like `NOERR`/`ERR_*`).
- What gets sent **next**, on success and on failure — this is what makes the flow section below possible.

Where a field's exact direction or provenance couldn't be pinned down from the decompile, that's called out
explicitly rather than guessed — see [Known gaps](#known-gaps) at the bottom.

## Session flow

The client moves through named server contexts (`svrtype`) as a session progresses. This is the actual
verbatim order, read out of the boot/login state machines:

Running the whole time, independent of the stage above:

- **Chat**: on entering LOBBY, `CMD_WATCH_ROOMSTATE`, `CMD_WATCH_MAINTETIME`, `CMD_WATCH_EMERGENCY`,
  `CMD_WATCH_SHORTMAIL`, `CMD_WATCH_IPANDPORT` are all registered together in one burst. `CMD_SEND_TEXTCHAT`
  + `CMD_WATCH_TEXTCHAT` are gated on `scene == LOBBY`.
- **Social**: `CMD_GET_BLACKLIST` fetch is immediately followed by registering `CMD_WATCH_FRIENDLIST` +
  `CMD_WATCH_FRIENDREQ`. Friend requests, invitations and mail (`CMD_SEND_FRIENDREQ`, `CMD_SEND_SHORTMAIL`,
  `CMD_SEND_INVITATION`, `CMD_ADD_BLACKLIST`, etc.) are all fire-when-clicked, no fixed sequence.
- **Community (COMMU)** and **Competition League (COMPLG)**: separate optional sub-flows reachable from
  LOBBY, summarized in [Community & league flow](#community-commu--competition-league-complg-flow) below.

## Verified per-command detail

Request/response columns are only filled where the decompile actually showed a field being set (request)
or read by name (response). `—` means bare (genuinely no fields at that call site), not "unknown". Where a
response is handed to an un-decompiled parser function, that's noted instead of guessing field names.

### Gate / handshake

| Command | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CMD_REG_SVRLIST` | opaque pre-built struct (no individual literal keys at the call site) | error-check only | First command sent on connect; sent again after the full gate sequence completes |
| `CMD_GET_SVRLIST` | `timeout`=20, `svrtype`="GATE", `lang` | not resolved (opaque parser `FUN_007336b0`/`FUN_0076b2a0`) | ok → `CMD_GET_SVRVERSION`; error → `CMD_GET_EULA` |
| `CMD_GET_SVRVERSION` | `svrtype`="GATE" | not resolved (`FUN_007336b0`) | → `CMD_GET_SVRTIME` |
| `CMD_GET_EULA` | `uri` (version/locale token) | **`eula`** (confirmed, read by name) | only taken if `CMD_GET_SVRLIST` errored |
| `CMD_GET_SVRTIME` | `svrtype`="GATE" | not resolved (`FUN_0072a550`) | → `CMD_GET_INFORMATIONLIST` |
| `CMD_GET_INFORMATIONLIST` | `svrtype`="GATE", `lang` | not resolved (`FUN_0072c280`) | → `CMD_GET_URLLIST` |
| `CMD_GET_URLLIST` | `svrtype`="GATE", `lang` | not resolved (`FUN_0072c6e0`) | → `CMD_DISCONNECT` → `CMD_REG_SVRLIST` |

### Account / login

| Command | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CMD_AUTH_GAMEID` | `gameid`, `gameid_password` (if a saved credential exists), `gameid_url_num`, `gameid_url` (list) | not resolved (`FUN_0072c100`) | → `CMD_DISCONNECT` → `CMD_LOGIN` |
| `CMD_LOGIN` | `svrtype`, `platform`, `style`, `loginid`, `loginid_password`, `use_regcode`, `regcode` (conditional), `patchver`, `dlcver`, `parahash`, `entryhash` | **`account_first_login`** (confirmed, read by name) | fully verified separately, see pass-1 companion; re-confirmed here at every relogin call site via the shared builder `FUN_007c4f40` |
| `CMD_CREATE_PLAYER` | `svrtype`="ACCOUNT", **`name`** | error-check only | → `CMD_SET_LANGUAGE` |
| `CMD_CHECK_STRING` | **`str`** (the string being validated) | error-check only | precedes `CMD_SET_PLAYERPROFILE` at one call site; standalone validator at another |
| `CMD_GET_PLAYERLIST` | `svrtype`="ACCOUNT" | player-slot count (via `FUN_00732d20`, exact field names not resolved) | → `CMD_GET_PRIVATEINFO` |
| `CMD_GET_PRIVATEINFO` | `svrtype`="ACCOUNT", **`pid`** (current profile) | not resolved (`FUN_00731c60`) | → `CMD_GET_DIVISIONUPDATE` |
| `CMD_SET_PLAYERPROFILE` | one field keyed `"svrtype"` but holding a **profile-type enum value**, not a service tag — flagged as ambiguous, possibly decompiler mis-association | error-check only | |

### Lobby / menu

| Command | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CMD_SET_CURRENTPLAYER` | `svrtype`="MENU", **`lang`**, `frame_rate`, `pcspec` | `useable_team_size`, `useable_team_id[]`, `mailcount`, `newmail`, `chat_probi`, `camera_probi`, `voice_probi`, `band_probi`, `green_ping`, `green_band`, `yellow_ping`, `yellow_band`, `red_ping`, `red_band`, `green_delay`, `yellow_delay`, `red_delay`, `p2ptimeout`, `first_login`, `lossframe_match`, `avg_max_combination`, `avg_total_combination`, `invite_num`, `check_lobbygame_ping_diff`, `check_game_ping_max`, `mcount10flg` — all read by name via `FUN_0072bb20` | sent right after login; response sets the session's ping/latency thresholds |
| `CMD_GET_BLOCKLIST` | `svrtype`="MENU" (or `"LOBBY"` at an alternate call site) | `count`, `bklist[i].player_num`, `bklist[i].max_player_num`, plus a per-block subfield (name built dynamically, not statically resolved) | caller picks the least-full block |
| `CMD_JOIN_BLOCK` | `svrtype`="MENU", `index` (chosen block), `ex_ip`, `ex_port`, `in_ip`, `in_port`, **`nat`** (NAT-type code; the function that originally computes it wasn't traced) | none read (success/fail only) | → `CMD_GET_PLAYERINFO`; registers `CMD_WATCH_ROOMLIST` + `CMD_WATCH_BLOCK_PLAYERLIST` |
| `CMD_GET_RANKING` | **`data`** (opaque pre-serialized filter blob), + one more optional key only sent when a UI filter is active (address not individually resolved) | not resolved (handled in a separate screen-refresh callback) | only sent if the local player has a ranking entry |

### Room lifecycle

#### Getting in: create/join, then a real peer-to-peer connect

`CMD_CREATEJOIN_ROOM` and `CMD_JOIN_ROOM` only get you *server-side* membership in the room. Actually
reaching the room owner is a separate, fully traced client-side state machine (`FUN_007b8ad0`) that runs
immediately after `CMD_JOIN_ROOM` succeeds:

```
CMD_JOIN_ROOM (room_id, is_invited, password)
  → response: room_owner.name, room_owner.pid, room_owner.xuid,
              ex_ip, ex_port, in_ip, in_port, x36_* (unused Xbox-360-parity fields)
  → wait for local "punch ready" flag
  → CMD_GET_IPANDPORT(pid = room_owner.pid)
  → response: ex_ip, ex_port (of the owner)
  → poll local P2P peer list for up to ~40s, looking for the owner's pid among
    currently-connected peers (FUN_007c8200 / FUN_00728d00)
  → real UDP hole-punch / connect attempt using the owner's ex/in ip:port
    (FUN_00f8f3c0 → FUN_00f94170 → FUN_00f937b0), ~40s timeout, polling a
    connection-state field for values 4 (connected) or 8 (failed)
  success → continues into the room                     failure/timeout at any step
                                                            → CMD_LEAVE_ROOM → poll ack → reset
```

This confirms match traffic (and the room-owner handshake itself) is **direct peer-to-peer**, not
server-relayed — the server's only role is introducing the two IP:port pairs via `CMD_JOIN_ROOM` +
`CMD_GET_IPANDPORT`.

#### Room settings (`game_env`)

`CMD_SET_GAMEENV` (host sends) and `CMD_WATCH_DECIDE_GAMEENV` (every member receives — same field shape) both
carry one `game_env` sub-object, cached in the room-context struct at offsets `+0x3ca8`–`+0x3cc8`. Every
field's valid values were read directly out of the client's enum-string tables (see
[Verified enum tables](#verified-enum-tables) below) rather than guessed:

| Field | Type | Valid values |
|---|---|---|
| `cpuLevel` | enum | `VERYEASY`, `EASY`, `NORMAL`, `HARD`, `VERYHARD`, `HARDEST` |
| `gametime` | enum | `NOSET`, `5MINUTES`, `10MINUTES`, `15MINUTES`, `20MINUTES`, `25MINUTES`, `30MINUTES` |
| `injury` | bool enum | `NO`, `YES` |
| `condition` | enum | `NORMAL`, `RANDOM` |
| `ball_type` | raw int | not enum-backed — direct index into the ball asset list |
| `exGame` | bool enum | `NO`, `YES` (extra-time toggle) |
| `pkOnOff` | bool enum | `NO`, `YES` (penalty shootout toggle) |
| `substitution` | raw int | substitution count, not enum-backed |
| `limitTime` | enum | `NOSET`, `SHORT`, `MIDDLE`, `LONG` |

#### Room / match state machine

`CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE`'s `status` field and `CMD_WATCH_DECIDE_GAMEPLAYER`'s `status` field share one enum
(6 values, read from the client's own string table):

```
WAITING ──► SETENV ──► GAME ──► RESULT
   ▲                                │
   └──────────── (room reset) ──────┘
        DISCONWAIT / RESULTWAIT — side states entered while a disconnect is being resolved
```

Confirmed from the in-match dispatcher: the client fires `CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE{status=SETENV}` when a match
is about to start, and `CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE{status=WAITING}` to reset the room back to its lobby state
afterward — both **host-initiated for `SETENV`, unconditional (any peer) for the reset to `WAITING`.**

#### Other room lifecycle commands

| Command | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CMD_CREATEJOIN_ROOM` | **`name`**, `match_type`, `team_category`, **`lang`**, `max_players`, `is_invite_limit`, `password`, `enable_guest` | **`room_id`** (confirmed, read by name — presence of this field = success) | has room_id → `CMD_SET_GAMEENV`; no room_id → `CMD_LEAVE_ROOM` |
| `CMD_LEAVE_ROOM` | — (bare at every call site) | — | universal abort/exit-room; used on every failure branch above |
| `CMD_SET_GUEST` | `has_guestplayer` | error-check only | re-sent whenever local guest-controller state changes |
| `CMD_CHANGE_ROOMNAME` | **`name`**, `passwd` | none | room-settings screen action |
| `CMD_KICK_ROOMMEMBER` | `target_pid` | none | |
| `CMD_ENTRY_GAME` | `entry`=1, **`side`** (`HOME`/`AWAY`, from controller-port bit) | none | guarded by local match phase == pre-match; "ready up" for the match |
| `CMD_GET_IPANDPORT` | `pid` (target — e.g. room owner) | `ex_ip`, `ex_port` (confirmed via helper) | called right after `CMD_JOIN_ROOM` succeeds |
| `CMD_WATCH_ROOMPLAYERLIST` | `room_id` | — | registered once `room_id` is known (after join/create), separate from the block-level watches |

#### Entry-game watch pushes (all 7 fully decompiled)

Registered together, bare, in one burst when the entry-game screen opens — this is how non-host room
members find out what the host is configuring:

| Watch | Fields pushed | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| `CMD_WATCH_DECIDE_GAMEENV` | full `game_env` (same 9 fields as `CMD_SET_GAMEENV` above) | broadcasts the host's room-settings changes to everyone else |
| `CMD_WATCH_DECIDE_GAMEPLAYER` | `status` (room/match state enum, above), `player_count`, an 8-slot ID array, an 8-slot `video` array (`FRAME_50`/`FRAME_60` — target framerate per slot) | per-slot roster + framerate broadcast |
| `CMD_WATCH_DECIDE_GAMEPLAYERENV` | `count`, then per entry: id, `side` (`HOME`/`AWAY`), `sideLeader` (`NO`/`YES`) | team-side and "who's the side captain" assignment |
| `CMD_WATCH_DISCON_PLAYERENV` | one field (minimal — just enough to identify what changed) | lightweight disconnect notice |
| `CMD_WATCH_DISCON_PLAYERMATCH` | `count`, then per entry: id, `side`, `sideLeader` — identical shape to `_GAMEPLAYERENV` | re-broadcasts side/captain assignments after a disconnect reshuffles them |
| `CMD_WATCH_ENTRY_GAME` | `entry_count`, then per entry: `pid`, `entryNum`, `gameNum` | tracks who has pressed "ready" (`gameNum == -1` = not yet entered); local ready-flag flips once more than one entry is complete |
| `CMD_WATCH_UPDATE_GAMERECORD` | none — bare signal only | just a "your match record was updated, go re-fetch it" ping |

### Quick match

| Command | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CMD_START_QUICKMATCH` | opaque struct + `my_pid` | **`result`** — confirmed closed enum: `ERR_QMATCH_NOTICE` (still searching), `ERR_QMATCH_STARTMATCHING` (matched), `ERR_QMATCH_CANCELED`, `ERR_QMATCH_PRECONNECT` (starts a 30s connect timer), `NOERR` (confirmed), `ERR_REFUSED`/`ERR_GETPLAYERFAIL` (→ `CMD_LEAVE_ROOM`) | each result value drives a distinct state transition — this is the clearest example of "what do I get back" in the whole protocol |
| `CMD_CANCEL_STARTQUICKMATCH` | — | — | sent only while still searching |
| `CMD_CANCEL_DECIDE_QUICKMATCH` | — | — | aborts a matched-but-unconfirmed quickmatch |

### In-match event pump

All of these are dispatched from one function (`FUN_007c1f80`) reacting to locally-queued local match
events (event `type` tag in parentheses); the table below is the event→command→fields mapping, fully
decompiled this pass — including the enum value tables, resolved directly from the client's own string
tables rather than inferred.

**Authority split, confirmed from the dispatcher's host-gate checks:** match-progression commands
(`CMD_CHANGE_GAMEPHASE`, `CMD_ADD_SCORE`, `CMD_ADD_FOUL`, `CMD_UPDATE_COMBINATION`, `CMD_SET_GAMETEAM`,
`CMD_SET_GAMEMEMBERENV`, `CMD_SET_GAMEMEMBER`, `CMD_SET_INJURYGAMEEND`, `CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE{SETENV}`) are
**host-only** (gated on a local "am I host" flag). Disconnect/sync-failure reporting
(`CMD_SEND_ABNORMALEND`, `CMD_SET_FORFEITEDGAMEEND`, `CMD_REQ_FORFEITEDGAME_REPLY`,
`CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE{WAITING}`) is **unconditional — any peer can send these**, since any peer can be the
one who disconnects or detects desync.

| 0 | `CMD_CHANGE_GAMEPHASE` | `phase` = one of `ENTRY`, `1ST`, `BREAK1`, `2ND`, `BREAK2`, `EX1ST`, `BREAK3`, `EX2ND`, `BREAK4`, `PK`, `END` (11-value enum, confirmed) | host-only |
| 1 | `CMD_SET_INJURYGAMEEND` | `side` = `HOME`/`AWAY` | host-only |
| 2 | `CMD_UPDATE_COMBINATION` | `total_comb`, `max_comb` (raw ints) | host-only |
| 3 | `CMD_ADD_SCORE` | `goal_side`, `goal_player_side`, `assist_side`, `assist_player_side` — each `HOME`/`AWAY`; `goal_gameplayer_id`, `assist_gameplayer_id`, `goal_player_pid` (raw ints) | host-only. Field **names** are certain; the mapping of which of the 4 raw event values (`event[9]`, `event[0xb]`, `event[5]`, `event[7]`) fills which "side" field is inferred from call order (very likely correct — computed and emitted in matching sequence) but not proven at the disassembly/register level — see [Known gaps](#known-gaps) |
| 4 | `CMD_ADD_FOUL` | `card_pid`, `card_side` (`HOME`/`AWAY`), `card_gameplayer_id`, `card_kind` (`YELLOW`/`RED`, confirmed 2-value enum), `injury_side` (`HOME`/`AWAY`), `injury_gameplayer_id`, nested `injury_data` (`symptom`, `level`, `level_no_self_conscious`), `injury_all`, `injury_one` | host-only. Same `injury_data` shape independently confirmed in the COMMU league injury-report call sites — canonical injury shape used everywhere |
| 5 | `CMD_SET_GAMETEAM` | `home_team_id`, `away_team_id` (raw ints) | host-only |
| 6 | `CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE` | `status` = `SETENV` (fixed) | host-only; fired entering the match-setup phase |
| 7 | `CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE` | `status` = `WAITING` (fixed) | **unconditional**; resets the room after a match |
| 8 | `CMD_SEND_ABNORMALEND` | `is_sync_failed` = `NO` (fixed) | unconditional |
| 9 | `CMD_SET_FORFEITEDGAMEEND` | **bare — zero fields** | unconditional; forfeit is keyed server-side off the existing room/game session |
| 10 | `CMD_SEND_ABNORMALEND` | `is_sync_failed` = `YES` if the event's resync flag is 1, else the raw flag value | unconditional; also flips a local "resync in progress" flag |
| 0xb | `CMD_SET_GAMEMEMBERENV` | whole opaque merged struct | host-only |
| 0xc | `CMD_SET_GAMEMEMBER` | bare | host-only |
| (push) | `CMD_REQ_FORFEITEDGAME_REPLY` | reply to an opponent's pushed forfeit request, consumed via `FUN_0072f5d0`/`FUN_007296c0` | unconditional, not tied to a local event — fires off an incoming push instead |
| (every tick) | `CMD_GET_GAMEADDPOINT` | — (bare) | called every tick from the pump, and again from a post-match community-stats screen before `CMD_SET_COMMU_MATCHINFO` |

Registered once at pump start (state 0), regardless of host status: `CMD_WATCH_ABNORMALEND`,
`CMD_WATCH_FORFEITEDGAMEEND`, `CMD_WATCH_INJURYGAMEEND`, `CMD_WATCH_OWNGOALGAMEEND` — every peer watches for
these regardless of who's hosting.

`CMD_GET_GAMERESULTS` (`pid` request, response → `FUN_007379a0`, not resolved) is a standalone results-screen
call, not part of the event pump itself.

### Verified enum tables

Pulled directly from the client's own string-lookup tables (`FUN_00bb0110`/`FUN_00bb0050`, indexed by a
small integer "enum type ID" — 55 types total, `0x00`–`0x36`), not inferred from proximity or guessed. Only
the types actually referenced by the commands documented above are listed; the mechanism generalizes to all
55 if more are needed later.

| Type ID | Used by | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `CMD_ADD_FOUL`'s `card_kind` | `YELLOW`, `RED` |
| `0x14` | `game_env.condition` | `NORMAL`, `RANDOM` |
| `0x15` | `game_env.cpuLevel` | `VERYEASY`, `EASY`, `NORMAL`, `HARD`, `VERYHARD`, `HARDEST` |
| `0x17` | `CMD_WATCH_DECIDE_GAMEPLAYER`'s per-slot `video` | `FRAME_50`, `FRAME_60` |
| `0x19` | every `side`/`sideLeader`-shaped field (`side`, `goal_side`, `card_side`, `injury_side`, etc.) | `HOME`, `AWAY` |
| `0x1a` | `CMD_CHANGE_GAMEPHASE`'s `phase` | `ENTRY`, `1ST`, `BREAK1`, `2ND`, `BREAK2`, `EX1ST`, `BREAK3`, `EX2ND`, `BREAK4`, `PK`, `END` |
| `0x1b` | `game_env.gametime` | `NOSET`, `5MINUTES`, `10MINUTES`, `15MINUTES`, `20MINUTES`, `25MINUTES`, `30MINUTES` |
| `0x1d` | `game_env.limitTime` | `NOSET`, `SHORT`, `MIDDLE`, `LONG` |
| `0x2d` | room/match `status` (`CMD_UPDATE_ROOMSTATE`, `CMD_WATCH_DECIDE_GAMEPLAYER`) | `WAITING`, `SETENV`, `GAME`, `RESULT`, `DISCONWAIT`, `RESULTWAIT` |
| `0x36` | generic boolean-style fields (`injury`, `exGame`, `pkOnOff`, `sideLeader`, `is_sync_failed`, `is_select_team`, …) | `NO`, `YES` |

## Community (COMMU) & Competition League (COMPLG) flow

These are optional sub-systems reachable from the lobby, not part of the critical path above. Coverage here
is request-side only (from the caller table) — response fields weren't deep-dived for these.

**Community** — browse/join, then compete:
```
CMD_SEARCH_COMMU (keyword, target, has_friends, target_pid)  or  CMD_GET_JOINEDCOMMULIST
  → CMD_JOIN_COMMU (commu_id, password)   or   CMD_CREATE_COMMU (commu_name, commu_description, password, invite_only)
  → CMD_SET_CURRENT_COMMU (commu_id)
  → registers CMD_WATCH_FRIENDLIST / CMD_WATCH_FRIENDREQ (right after a CMD_GET_BLACKLIST fetch)
  → CMD_GET_COMMU_LEAGUELIST → CMD_JOIN_COMMU_LEAGUE (compe_id)
  → CMD_APPLY_COMMU_MATCH (match_id, room_id)  ⇄  CMD_REPLY_COMMU_MATCH (match_id, reply)
  → match proceeds through the normal ROOM flow above
  → CMD_GET_COMMU_*RANKING / *RESULTS (post-match stats)
  → CMD_LEAVE_COMMU_LEAGUE / CMD_WITHDRAW_COMMU (commu_id)
```

**Competition League** — very similar shape:
```
CMD_GET_COMPLG_LIST
  → CMD_JOIN_COMPLG / CMD_CREATE_COMPLG
  → CMD_SET_COMPLG_TEAM (per-player injury_data sub-struct)
  → CMD_ENTRY_COMMU_LEAGUECELL (cell_id)
  → matches proceed
  → CMD_GET_COMPLG_MYRESULTS / rankings
  → CMD_LEAVE_COMPLG / CMD_QUIT_COMPLG / CMD_END_COMMU_LEAGUE
```

## Enum catalog

Confirmed by direct code reading (string-literal comparisons against a `"result"`-style field, e.g. the
`CMD_START_QUICKMATCH` dispatcher above) rather than proximity-mined.

### Result / error codes
`NOERR` = success. 116 named failure codes exist, following `ERR_<AREA>_<REASON>` or `ERR_<REASON>`:

### Connection type (`svrtype`)
`GATE` → `ACCOUNT` → `LOBBY`/`MENU`, confirmed in the flow above as literal string arguments at each stage
transition. `NETCLIENT` is a separate internal pseudo-command tag (not a real `svrtype` value), also sent
through the same wrapper.

### Other small enums (from earlier proximity-mining, lower confidence — see caveat)
`logoutstat`: `FIN`/`MOV`/`NONE`. Team category: `ALL`/`NATIONAL`/`NATIONALCLUB`/`CLUB`. Match/room type:
`OC_RANKING`/`OC_FREE`/`LEGENDS`/`COMMU`/`COMMU_LEAGUE`. These were *not* re-verified against decompiled
code in this pass — treat as plausible leads only. (The match-**phase** sequence, `ENTRY`/`1ST`/`BREAK1`/
`2ND`/.../`END`, *was* re-verified this pass — see [Verified enum tables](#verified-enum-tables) — and
turned out to have one extra value, `1ST`/`2ND`, that the earlier mining pass had missed.)

## Competition League (COMPLG) reachability

Checked specifically because the client visibly doesn't offer this feature by default: is it gated by a
server-sent flag, or is the code just not wired in?

**`CMD_GET_SVRLIST`'s response carries no such flag.** Its real parser (`FUN_0076b2a0`) only reads
`server_num` and, per entry, `svrlist[i].svrtype/svrname/svrport/svraddr/max_player_num/player_num/svrgid`
— pure connection routing. The client also only forwards entries whose `svrtype` is `MENU`, `ACCOUNT`, or
`VDPCHAT`; anything else present in the list is silently dropped by this build.

**The real cause: the menu path into COMPLG is dead code, not conditionally hidden.**

| Function | Sends | Live references (call or data) in the whole binary |
|---|---|---|
| `0x007432c0` | `CMD_GET_COMPLG_KIND_LIST` | **none** |
| `0x0073e920` | `CMD_GET_COMPLG_LIST` | **none** |
| `0x0073fc10` | `CMD_SET_COMPLG_TEAM` | **none** |
| `0x00740650` | `CMD_WATCH_COMPLG_END` | **none** |
| `0x00741ad0` | `CMD_GET_COMPLG_TEAM_DATA` | called from `FUN_007a9340` (a small state-machine class) |
| `FUN_007a9340`'s vtable (2 copies, `0x0114ea4c`/`0x01157abc`) | — | **none** — the class itself is never instantiated |

The UI scene-name registry (`netMainmenu`, `netRoomCreate`, `netMatching`, `net_lobby_select`,
`net_server_select`, etc. — the same table `CMD_WATCH_ROOMLIST` and friends live next to) has **no**
`netComplg`/competition entry. A plain `"COMPETITION"` string exists in the binary, but it's in the generic
text/label table, unconnected to any menu item.

**Conclusion:** the protocol commands and a few backing C++ classes for Competition League are compiled
into the client, but the menu navigation path that would trigger them was removed/never wired up in this
build. It's not something a server response can toggle back on — publicly, PES2010's online competitions
were real, time-limited events Konami ran server-side during the game's live years, but the reachable
client-side trigger for them isn't present in this executable's menu graph.

**Not yet checked**: whether `CMD_JOIN_COMPLG` / `CMD_CREATE_COMPLG` (joining/creating a specific
competition, as opposed to browsing the list) have any live callers independent of the browse screen.

## Known gaps

- **Response field names not yet resolved** for `CMD_GET_SVRLIST`, `CMD_GET_SVRVERSION`, `CMD_GET_SVRTIME`,
  `CMD_GET_INFORMATIONLIST`, `CMD_GET_URLLIST`, `CMD_GET_RANKING`, `CMD_GET_GAMERESULTS`,
  `CMD_GET_GAMEADDPOINT` — each hands its response to a dedicated parser function that exists but wasn't
  itself decompiled. Request-side fields for all of these are confirmed. (The 7 entry-game watch pushes that
  were in this list last pass are now fully resolved — see [Room lifecycle](#room-lifecycle).)
- **`CMD_ADD_SCORE`**: all 7 key *names* are certain (including the `HOME`/`AWAY` enum values). Which of the
  4 raw event fields (`event[9]`, `event[0xb]`, `event[5]`, `event[7]`) fills which of the 4 "side" keys is
  inferred from call/computation order, not proven at the disassembly-register level — the only remaining
  ambiguity in this whole command.
- **`CMD_SET_PLAYERPROFILE`**: reuses the literal key `"svrtype"` for what's actually a profile-index value
  — flagged as ambiguous, not asserted as a real service-tag reuse.
- **`CMD_JOIN_BLOCK`**'s `nat` value provenance — it's read from a cached struct field, but the
  NAT-detection code that originally populates it wasn't traced.
- Community/League section is request-only; nobody has decompiled the response parsers for that subsystem
  yet.
- 28 commands from pass 1 (mostly `CMD_SEND_*`/`CMD_SET_*` one-way calls and some `CMD_WATCH_*`) have no
  verified data here at all — they weren't among the 123 call sites found, meaning either they're sent from
  a code path outside the normal UI flow (e.g. peer-to-peer relay) or via a helper this survey didn't reach.
